Hello!
I am an experimental particle physicist and a **postdoctoral research associate at Argonne National Laboratory**. My research is focused on the ATLAS experiment at CERN and I am primarily interested in searching for physics beyond the Standard Model. 

I’m especially interested in characterizing the known phenomena of the SM and hunting for contributions of new physics in rare SM processes, such as the tri-boson WWW. I am also interested in silicon-based detector R&D and am currently working on the ATLAS experiment’s Inner Tracker upgrade for the High Luminosity LHC by assembling and testing silicon modules. 

Prior to my current position, I obtained my Ph.D. in Physics with Prof. Toyoko Orimoto at Northeastern University’s CMS group. I developed and led a new CMS search that searched for the exotic decay of the Higgs boson into light pseudoscalars with four photons in the final state. I also spent my time as a PhD student on the operations of the CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter and on the timing upgrade of CMS.


Besides actively doing research on ATLAS, I am currently spending some time on learning ML techniques for physics and software tools to make my analyses efforts faster.

**I am always happy to interact and collaborate on potential projects, ideas, and analyses**. Feel free to shoot me an email if you want to get in touch!


<!-- Work in Progress. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
