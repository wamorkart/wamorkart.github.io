Hello!
I am an experimental particle physicist and a postdoctoral research associate at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). My work is focused on the ATLAS experiment at CERN. My primary research interest is searching for physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). 

I’m especially interested in characterizing the known phenomena of the SM and hunting for contributions of new physics in rare SM processes. I am also currently working on the ATLAS experiment’s tracker upgrade for the High Luminosity LHC by assembling and testing the silicon-based modules which will constitute ATLAS’s upgraded pixel detector. 

Prior to my current position, I worked as a PhD student with Toyoko Orimoto at Northeastern University’s CMS group. I developed and led a new search that utilized the Higgs boson as a probe for physics beyond SM. I also spent my time as a PhD student on the operation of the CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter and on the timing upgrade of CMS.

<!-- Work in Progress. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
