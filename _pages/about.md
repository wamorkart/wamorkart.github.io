Hello!
I’m a particle physicist and a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://physics.berkeley.edu/">University of California, Berekeley</a> and in the <a href="https://www.physics.lbl.gov/machinelearning/">Machine Learning for Fundamental Physics group at the Lawrence National Laboratory</a>. Previously, I have been a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.anl.gov/hep/atlas-at-the-the-large-hadron-collider-lhc">ATLAS group at Argonne National Laboratory</a> from October 2021 through May 2024. 

My work is centred at the development and application of machine learning based techniques and tools to discover new physics at the <a href="https://atlas.cern/">ATLAS</a> experiment at the <a href="https://www.home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider">Large Hadron Collider</a>. 
<!-- I am a particle physicist and a **postdoctoral researcher at University of California Berkeley and Lawrence National Laboratory**. My research is focused on the ATLAS experiment at CERN and I am primarily interested in searching for physics beyond the Standard Model through the lens of machine learning.  -->

<!-- I’m especially interested in characterizing the known phenomena of the SM and hunting for contributions of new physics in rare SM processes, such as the tri-boson WWW. I am also interested in silicon-based detector R&D and am currently working on the ATLAS experiment’s Inner Tracker upgrade for the High Luminosity LHC by assembling and testing silicon modules.  -->

I obtained my Ph.D. in Physics in the high energy physics group at <a href="https://cos.northeastern.edu/physics/">Northeastern University</a>, supervised by Prof. Toyoko Orimoto. I developed and led a novel search for the exotic decay of the Higgs boson into light pseudoscalars with four photons in the final state on the CMS experiment. As a graduate student, I also specialized in the operation of the CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter and the timing upgrade of CMS experiment for the high luminosity LHC era.


<!-- Besides actively doing research on ATLAS, I am currently spending some time on learning ML techniques for physics and software tools to make my analyses efforts faster. -->

**I am always happy to interact and collaborate on potential projects, ideas, and analyses**. Feel free to shoot me an email if you want to get in touch!
