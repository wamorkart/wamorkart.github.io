Hello!
I’m a particle physicist and a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berekeley and a part of the <a href="https://www.physics.lbl.gov/machinelearning/">Machine Learning for Fundamental Physics group</a> at Lawrence National Laboratory. I perform my research in <a href="https://nachmangroup.github.io/index.html">Dr. Benjamin Nachman's group</a>.

I am interested in developing and applying machine learning techniques and tools to make new discoveries in particle physics and improve our understanding of the fundamental nature of our universe. As a member of the ATLAS collaboration, I work on developing and implementing machine learning methods to study data from the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. 

Previously, I have been a postdoctoral researcher in the ATLAS group at Argonne National Laboratory from October 2021 through May 2024. At Argonne, in addition to perfoming precision measurements of the Standard Model at the LHC, I was playing a key role in the upgrade of the ATLAS Tracker for the High Luminosity LHC. My experience in detector development—particularly in silicon tracking and timing detectors—has been instrumental in shaping my research trajectory as an experimentalist.

<!-- I am a particle physicist and a **postdoctoral researcher at University of California Berkeley and Lawrence National Laboratory**. My research is focused on the ATLAS experiment at CERN and I am primarily interested in searching for physics beyond the Standard Model through the lens of machine learning.  -->

<!-- I’m especially interested in characterizing the known phenomena of the SM and hunting for contributions of new physics in rare SM processes, such as the tri-boson WWW. I am also interested in silicon-based detector R&D and am currently working on the ATLAS experiment’s Inner Tracker upgrade for the High Luminosity LHC by assembling and testing silicon modules.  -->

I earned my Ph.D. in Physics from Northeastern University as part of the high-energy physics group, under the supervision of Prof. Toyoko Orimoto. My research focused on developing and leading a novel search for the exotic decay of the Higgs boson into light pseudoscalars using photons, utilizing data from the CMS experiment. This analysis—the first of its kind at CMS—explored an extremely rare and experimentally challenging Higgs boson decay.

As an experimentalist, I am excited by the prospect of exploring new research areas and thrive on tackling new challenges.
In addition to my research projects, I enjoy learning new software tools to imrpove the efficiency and speed of my analyses and research work.

**I am always happy to interact and collaborate on potential projects, ideas, and analyses**. Feel free to shoot me an email if you want to get in touch!
