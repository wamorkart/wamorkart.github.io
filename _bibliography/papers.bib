  abstract={The MIP Timing Detector of the CMS detector will provide precision timestamps with 40 ps resolution for all charged particles up to a pseudorapidity of η=3.0. This upgrade will mitigate the effects of pile-up expected under the High-Luminosity LHC running conditions and bring new and unique capabilities to the CMS detector. The endcap region of the MIP Timing Detector, called the Endcap Timing Layer, will be instrumented with silicon Low-Gain Avalanche Diodes, covering the high-radiation pseudorapidity region 1.6<η<3.0. The LGAD sensors will be read out by the ETROC readout chip, which is being designed for precision timing measurements. We present recent progress in the characterization of LGAD sensors for the Endcap Timing Layer and the development of ETROC, including test beam and bench measurements.}

abstract = {During 2017, the Large Hadron Collider provided proton–proton collisions up to an integrated luminosity of 50/fb and the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment was able to record 90.3% of this data. The electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) of CMS was able to achieve excellent data collection efficiency owing to its reliable data acquisition (DAQ) system. The modular and scalar schema followed by the ECAL DAQ system means that ECAL crystals are divided in sectors, each of which is controlled by three interconnected boards. A multi-machine distributed software configures the electronic boards and follows the life cycle of the acquisition process. The increase in instantaneous luminosity during Run II has resulted in an increase in the number of occasional errors due to radiation effects. To combat this, ECAL DAQ has been equipped with automatic recovery procedures and monitoring services.}

  abstract = {Precise calibration and alignment of the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) is crucial for achieving excellent ECAL performance required by many physics analyses employing electrons and photons. The methods used to inter-calibrate the ECAL energy response, using physics channels such as W/Z boson decays to electrons and π0∕η decays to photon pairs, and also exploiting the azimuthal symmetry of the minimum bias events are presented here. In addition, the details of the alignment procedure used to calibrate the position measurements in ECAL relative to the CMS Tracker is also described. Lastly, results of the calibration and alignment obtained with Run 2 data are presented.}
